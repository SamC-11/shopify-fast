# FALL 2022 SHOPIFY BACKEND DEVELOPER CHALLENGE
This is my submission for the Shopify Backend Developer Challenge. 
The extra feature I chose was: Ability to create warehouses/locations and assign inventory to specific locations

Since there was no ui-requirement, I just went ahead and spun up a quick little API that is easy to use for frontend developers. Got to learn a new framework too! üçæ

Made with FastAPI and :blue_heart: by Sam


# SETUP
requirements: python 3.x

step 1: clone this repository into your local computer\
step 2: create a python virtual environment (you can use venv and run ``` python -m venv env_name ```\
step 3: activate your python virtual environment ```env_name/Scripts/activate```\
step 4: install dependencies with ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ``` \
step 5: cd into the shopify-fast/src folder
step 6: run ```uvicorn main:app --reload```. This command will start the server in debug mode
step 7: open up your browser and navigate to localhost:8000/docs for a list of all of the endpoints fully documented by openapi
step 8: have fun!
